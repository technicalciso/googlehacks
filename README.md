# Google Hacks
A small (very small at the moment) collection of OSINT and security hacks using the Google API and custom search engines.  Many of these are featured in tutorials or other articles on https://technicalciso.com.

This repo includes:
 1. Flashfinder

## Flashfinder
This script uses Google to search for Adobe Flash on a website. Results are individually checked to ensure Flash files still exist and are not from an aging cache.  Flashfinder runs on Linux using the bash shell.  To use Flashfinder, download a copy and run
```
./flashfinder.sh <site>
```
